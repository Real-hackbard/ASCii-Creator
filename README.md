# ASCii-Creator:

Load and generate ASCII images with one click.
With this ASCII generator, you can change the intensity of the ASCII code. This means you can adjust the calculation of the respective color of the image. A black and white image is calculated differently than an image containing red, green, and blue tones. For a universal image, i.e., a single-color image, the calculation can be modified so that the ASCII conversion is more noticeable than with a standard calculation.

The following image formats are loaded:
*.BMP; *.JPG; *.JPEG; *.GIF; *.PNG; *.EMF; *.WMF; *.ICO;

The program uses all TTF font files installed on the system, but for a nice ASCII image, you should use the "Courier New" font set.
The output is compatible with all text documents or string boxes on the Windows system.
